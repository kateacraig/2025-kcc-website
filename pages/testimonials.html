              the format with slides and discussion and hands-on exercises to
              make the information tangible and usable. Kate adapted the
              discussion to fit the needs of the specific candidates she was
              addressing, which made the session both significant and relatable.
              It was an impressive workshop that gave our candidates a real

              Consulting."

              as ideas pour onto the page; or even years of education in grammar
              become muddled as I wrestled with sentences amid “writer’s block.”
              I hired Kate Craig as my editor in each case. She provided clarity
              and corrections where needed, and never overshadowed my voice as
              an author and teacher."
